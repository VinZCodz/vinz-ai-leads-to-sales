# Leads Dashboard (demo)

This is a small Next.js demo placed inside `src/frontend/leads-dashboard` showing:

- A form to collect `productName`, `productDescription`, and `targetPersona` and generate 3 leads.
- A paginated table that displays leads and a "Send Mail" button to preview/send (mock) outreach.

Quick start (from repo root):

```bash
cd src/frontend/leads-dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3001
